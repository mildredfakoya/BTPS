<p>In keeping with COVID-19 protocols all parents and students coming on premises for dropping off by the gate must have face masks properly covering their faces (nose to chin). Temperature
checks and hand washing/ hand sanitizing will be done upon arrival withno exceptions.
All visits to the office to pay fees, collect receipts or purchase uniforms must be scheduled by appointment. Parents are encouraged as much as possible to make payments directly to the bank and submit bank deposit
slips or transaction reference numbers via email. School issued receipts can then be placed directly into the childrenâ€™s backpacks.
We ask all parents to be exceptionally vigilant with their health and the health of their children and should they note ANYONE in their
household experiencing any of the following symptoms, we must insist
children be kept home:
<ul>
<li>Fever or chills</li>
<li>Cough or runny nose (cause not relevant), congestion</li>
<li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
<li>Fatigue, muscle or body aches</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Recent loss of taste or smell</li>
<li>Sore throat</li>
</ul>
We remind parents that they are instrumental with helping us control the possible spread of COVID-19 at our school by taking the necessary precautionary measures and being upfront with disclosing relevant
information that will allow us to keep all our students safe.</p>
<p>In Term 1 additional features of our online learning management system
will include: discussion forums for students, an e-library for reading and
text books and built in video-conferencing. Portal Orientation for all
students from Grade 1 to High School will take place in-class during the
first week of school. All students from Grade 1 through to Grade 11
must have access to a laptop or android tablet to access our school portal
throughout the term</p>
